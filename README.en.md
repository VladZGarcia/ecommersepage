## Individual Reflection

My main contribution to the e-commerce project has been designing and implementing core components for product data management and product presentation. I have created both logic and UI components that form the foundation for how products are handled and displayed in the application.

### Files and folders I have created

- **product-data.tsx**  
  I have built the entire data layer for products, including functions to fetch, search, filter, add, update, and delete products via API. This file is the hub for all product data and makes it easy to reuse logic throughout the project.

- **products.ts**  
  I have defined all TypeScript interfaces for products, categories, reviews, and metadata. This has given the project a robust type structure and ensured that all product data is consistent and typed, reducing bugs and speeding up development.

- **product-card folder**  
  I have created and structured all components for displaying individual products in the UI, including image, details, header, and buttons. These components are reusable and used in product lists, search results, and product pages. I have focused on designing them responsively and accessibly.

- **product-details folder**  
  I have built components to display detailed information about a product, such as description, price, images, reviews, and shipping information. These components allow the user to get a complete picture of the product and make purchase decisions.

### Functionality and integrations I have contributed

- I have contributed to making **SearchBar**, **CategoryList**, and **Pagination** work together.  
  By further developing the logic in the project, I have made it possible for the user to search, filter by category, and paginate at the same time ‚Äì with preserved filters and search terms in the URL.  
  This required me to integrate and synchronize these components so that they work seamlessly together, even though I did not create them from scratch.

- I have implemented that the **search-bar** automatically closes when clicking outside the search field, improving the user experience and reducing the risk of the search field remaining open unnecessarily.

- I have also added functionality so that the **search-bar** closes immediately when clicking on a product card in the searchbar-dropdown, providing a smooth and intuitive flow for the user.

## Techniques and solutions

- **TypeScript interfaces** for safe and scalable data management
- **Asynchronous API calls** with error handling for robust data logic
- **Modular component structure** in React/Next.js for reusability and easy further development
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS to optimize the user experience on all devices
- **Integration of filtering, searching, and pagination** for a cohesive and user-friendly product experience
- **Event handling and DOM interaction** to handle clicks outside and automatically close components

## Results and value

By creating these files and folders and integrating filtering, searching, and pagination, I have laid the foundation for a scalable and maintainable e-commerce platform. My code has made it easy to manage product data, display products attractively, and build on the functionality in the project. I have contributed both technical structure and user-friendly interfaces that are central to the project's success.

## Future improvements

I see potential to further develop:

- More advanced filtering and sorting of products
- Caching and optimization of API calls
- More UI improvements for product presentation and interaction
- Improved error handling and user feedback
